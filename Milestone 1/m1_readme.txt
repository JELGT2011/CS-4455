All requirements are completed.  However, there are a few small bugs outside of the requirements that testers should be aware of.  The character does not jump as high as I would like, 
so he cannot jump onto the stairs.  Additionally, to get up the ramp, you must jump over the initial surface angle change.

Controls:
A standard XBox controller should work.  Move using the left joystick.
A - Jump
X - Left Attack
Y - Combo
B - Right Attack

Assets:
The mesh is a custom skin for the League of Legends champion "Ekko".  The skin can be downloaded here: http://leaguecraft.com/skins/61873-ekko-light-of-time.xhtml
The rigging for the character was created with Mixamo's auto rigging tool.
All of the animations for the character also comes from Mixamo's animation library.
The rest of the assets came from the Unity standard assets.

Requirements:
The movement is controlled by the left joystick of a controller, where the magnitude of the x and y space is the speed, and the angle controls the direction the character faces.
This movement is the blend tree.  You can see by lightly tapping the controller he starts off in a walk state.  As the joystick is pressed in a direction, he slowly transitions into 
a running motion.
